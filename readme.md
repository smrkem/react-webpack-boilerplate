# React-webpack boilerplate  

This is my starting point for new react projects.

I'm still new to webpack, and tired of pasting in config I didn't fully understand. This is built from the ground up. Suggestions welcome.  

### Notes  
- webpack must be installed globally (`$ npm i webpack -g`)  

- unhappy with where webpack-dev-server is serving from. currently `npm start` creates `index.html`, `styles.css` and `bundle.js` in the root directory which then need to be .gitignored
